## 2024-07-25 - UX for CLIs is DX

**Learning:** UX principles are not limited to graphical interfaces. For command-line applications, the user experience is the developer experience (DX). A small improvement, like making console output clearer, better structured, and more actionable, is a valid and impactful micro-UX enhancement. Chaining commands for the user's next step is a great example of reducing friction.

**Action:** When working on backend or CLI applications, I will treat the console output as a primary user interface and look for opportunities to improve its clarity, structure, and guidance.
